## observability/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboard.yml


# This YAML file tells Grafana how to load and manage dashboards from JSON files on startup.
#
# Key structure:
# - apiVersion: Version of the provisioning API (currently always 1).
# - providers: A list of dashboard sources to load into Grafana.
#   - name: Internal name of the provider block (can be anything, e.g., 'default').
#   - folder: Grafana folder where the dashboards will be placed ('' = General folder).
#   - type: Method for loading dashboards ('file' = from local JSON files).
#   - disableDeletion: Prevent dashboards from being deleted in the UI (false = allow deletion).
#   - editable: Whether dashboards are editable in the Grafana UI.
#   - options.path: Filesystem path (inside the container) where dashboard JSON files are located.
